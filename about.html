        Over two decades leading creative innovation, brand development, and strategic communication across Latin America and the United States.<br><br>
        Jorge is a creative director whose work has earned recognition at Cannes Lions, D&AD, El Sol, El Ojo de Iberoamérica, and FIAP — and he was named Creative Director of the Year three times in a row by Paraguay’s Creative Circle.<br><br>
        He has led integrated campaigns for brands like Personal, Toyota, Pilsen, UNICEF, Banco Itaú, and Meta Sports. With a focus on turning bold ideas into tangible results, his approach blends narrative design, art direction, and strategic thinking to shape culture and impact business.<br><br>
        As a freelancer, standout projects include Nike’s entry into Paraguay with Club Olimpia — featured globally by @nikefootball — where he led copy, art, and creative direction; Pilsen’s anniversary campaign, where he crafted both concept and TV script; and the full brand launch of Santo Tomás.<br><br>
        He has served on international juries, taught at creative schools, and now advises companies from Italy — helping brands evolve, tell better stories, and navigate the digital landscape.

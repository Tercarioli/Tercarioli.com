    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: October 2, 2025</p>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        By subscribing to the service at <strong>tercarioli.com</strong>, you acknowledge having read, understood,
        and accepted these Terms &amp; Conditions. If you do not agree, please do not subscribe or use the service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By subscribing to the service at <strong>tercarioli.com</strong>, the user acknowledges having read, understood,
      and accepted these Terms &amp; Conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      The service consists of providing creative direction and consulting under a monthly subscription model.
      No employment, partnership, or exclusivity relationship is created between the parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscription and Payments</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Payments are made in advance and on a recurring basis through the designated payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).</li>
      <li>The subscription automatically renews each month unless canceled by the user beforehand.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Cancellation by the Client</h2>
    <p>
      The client may cancel their subscription at any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the current
      billing period. No partial refunds will be issued for already paid periods.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cancellation by the Provider</h2>
    <p>
      The provider reserves the right to unilaterally cancel a subscription for personal, ethical, or professional reasons
      (e.g., conflict of interest, repeated breaches, or circumstances that make the relationship unviable).
      In such cases, the client will be notified and, where applicable, a proportional refund will be issued for the
      unused portion of the service.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Scope of Service</h2>
    <p>
      The service is limited to the conditions established in the subscribed plan (<strong>Focus</strong>,
      <strong>Growth</strong>, or <strong>Partner</strong>). Any additional or out-of-scope work must be agreed upon separately.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      Both parties agree to maintain confidentiality regarding any information shared during the professional relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The client acquires the right to use the deliverables produced during the service.</li>
      <li>The provider retains the right to showcase such work as part of their portfolio, unless expressly agreed otherwise.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      The service is provided “as is.” The provider guarantees the professional delivery of creative services but does not
      warrant specific business outcomes (e.g., sales, growth).
    </p>

    <h2>10. Amendments to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The provider may update these Terms &amp; Conditions at any time. Changes will be communicated and become effective upon
      publication on the website.
    </p>
